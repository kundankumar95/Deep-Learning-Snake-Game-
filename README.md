Deep Learning Snake Game
Overview
This project implements a deep reinforcement learning agent to play the classic Snake game. The agent is trained using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn and master the game over numerous episodes. The goal is to train an agent that can effectively navigate and score high in the game environment.

Features
Deep Q-Network (DQN): Trains an agent to play the Snake game using reinforcement learning.
Game Environment: Custom Snake game environment implemented with pygame.
Training Pipeline: Scripts for training the agent and monitoring performance.
Model Checkpointing: Save and load model weights during training.
Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/kundankumar95/Snake-Game.git
cd Snake-Game
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Snake Game
To play the Snake game manually, run:

bash
Copy code
python game.py
Training the DQN Agent
To train the DQN agent, run:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
This script will train the agent on the Snake game environment and print training progress to the console.

Training
The training script (train.py) trains the DQN agent using the following parameters:

Episodes: Number of episodes for training.
Batch Size: Number of experiences to sample for each training step.
Learning Rate: Learning rate for the optimizer.
Adjust the hyperparameters in train.py according to your needs.
